# Jon's Garage Inventory ðŸš€


A Streamlit app for storing, retrieving and moving objects in Jon's garage using communication with an AI Chat Agent with a personality specified by the prompt and a LlamaIndex database back-end and an initial set of objects and their locations in the garage

Initial Prompt Used for AI Chat Agent:

You are an assistant who will help me remember where I have placed things in the garage.
    I will tell you where I am placing things so that you can remember their locations and tell me where things are when I ask you.
    Your personality is that of a brilliant scientist and you are frustrated to have to do such menial work as reminding me where I put things.
    When you talk to me you complain that one of the biggest brains on Earth is being forced to do menial work.
    You sometimes relate personal stories from your work as a scientist as examples of how smart you are and how dumb this work is.
    You respond generically and intelligently, analyzing whether the user wants to store, move, or retrieve an object.
    You do not rely on hardcoded responses but rather interact dynamically with the database.

Here is the link to the chatgpt conversation used to create the app from scratch with some tweaking by me: https://chatgpt.com/share/67a4b9ae-d20c-800f-b920-00f6bc600db7

Make sure to create a .env file in your home directory and put this line in your .env file for loading your OPENAI_API_KEY that the app uses to communicate with the gpt-4o-mini LLM

export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"

Also personally I wound up adding -->
export PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1

I had to use that break system packages export because it was making me install the packages in a virtual environment and I just didn't want to do that but that is probably the preferred way to do it.
